# Subjectivity-Mining-Ass3
Run your notebook on colab, which has (limited) free access to GPUs.
You need to enable GPUs for the notebook:
● navigate to Edit → Notebook Settings
● select GPU from the Hardware Accelerator drop-down

1. Install the simpletransformers library: !pip install simpletransformers
(you will have to restart your runtime after the installation)
2. Load the pre-trained language models
BERT (e.g., ClassificationModel('bert', 'bert-base-cased')) and RoBERTa.

(Most will follow from logic following the notebook)
